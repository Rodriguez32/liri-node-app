# liri-node-app

In this assignment we made LIRI. LIRI is a Language_Interpretation and Recognition Interface. It is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data.

Works with Twitter API and Spotify API. We applied for keys and tokens. 

Liri.js should take in one of the following commands:
<ul>

<li>"my-tweets" - this will log my latest 20 tweets<li>
<li>"spotify-this-song"- this will log a song with artist info<li>
<li>"movie-this"- this will log a movie and its info<li>
<li>"do-what-it-says"- this will run a song that I called for in random.txt<li>

</ul>
